# Installation & Setup

Install and run Redis: http://redis.io/download

    redis-server

Run the application via node:

    cd node-multidraw
    npm install
    node server.js

To run it daemonised, use `forever`, `daemonize2` or this command form:

    `cd node-multidraw; nohup node server.js >/dev/null 2>&1 &`

# Usage

Once running visit

    `localhost:5000` for default canvas: "main lobby"

or

    `localhost:5000/c/room-name` to implicitly create a new canvas

## Guided mode (assisted learning extension)

Author: Pip Jones
Status: WIP / early alpha!

For the assisted learning model, the following route is the admin screen:

    `localhost:5000/a/`

Click 'new session' with a user connected, to begin a new test/training session. Everyone will be redirected to:

    `localhost:5000/a/SESSION/PAGE` (admin)
    `localhost:5000/s/SESSION/PAGE` (user)

where `SESSION` is the session name the admin made up, and `PAGE` will initially be 0.
The canvas name stored is `SESSION.PAGE`.

The admin administers the test, then clicks 'Next Page', again everyone is redirected to a new canvas.

The admin can go back through previous pages to review/print analyse the test subject's performance.

# TODO

For Assisted Learning Alpha trial:

- Admin screen listing previous user sessions to browse & review
- upload BG image (NO! provide a hardcoded list of URLS - this will come from the CMS)
- read-only mode to review/print canvas

Later:
- Allow the screens to be rendered from another website - more like a JQuery plugin which calls this codebase via socket/API.
i.e. separating the page-load/rendering from the drawing functionality.
I want to be able to run the system from another existing web application which hosts the
assitive learning test structure, content and records the results.
- authentication
- prepared sequence of BG images (a preset test)
- convert to new multi-draw project
- implement proper partitioning of canvases (sessions) and connections
